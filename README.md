## About This Project
The goal of is to illustrate how users may refine large language model prompts and responses, tailoring them more precisely to specific requests related to different target audiences.

The initial proposal for this simple web app was to show how one of the roles of a media producer could be almost fully automated through the use of large language models, specifically OpenAI's Chat GPT.

The scope of this tool was designed for the CUNY Graduate Center's Large Language Models and ChatGPT course by Michelle A. McSweeney - specifically, the Fall 2023 semester's OpenAI Playground lab and the Oct. 30 class discussion on Labor & Creative Production led by Kelly Cunningham, Ruby Chu, and Michael Smith (notes, presentation). The in-class exercise highlighted the vulnerability of several jobs from my past career, notably News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists (27-3023.00).

For example, at a major network news organization in the mid-2010s, it was typical to employ producers who would watch news wires, broadcasts, and Twitter feeds in order to quickly and accurately produce the following:

* text-based articles for publishing to one or more news-branded or lifestyle websites,
* review and optimize articles for best SEO performance,
* create a series of social media posts for promotion of said web articles via Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn,
* create a television broadcast script for quick production of a web-exclusive video segment,
* forward a summary recap to editors at various syndication partners and topical-interest sites, and,
* log a note off the published posts in a daily rundown.

Depending on the story, these steps might take a producer from 10 minutes to an hour to edit, or longer for actively developing news. Now with such public LLM-based tools OpenAI's Chat GPT, Google Bard, Anthropic Claude, and many others, such tasks may be done in seconds.

While automating receptive tasks, increasing efficiency, and helping fine-tune the performance of large language models may be all fine and good, such a disruptive change in is having an immediate impact on a whole class of creative professionals. For example, take the rather clickbait-savvy headline "I Lost My Job to ChatGPT and Was Made Obsolete. I Was Out of Work for 3 Months Before Taking a New Job Passing Out Samples at Grocery Stores." by Emily Hanley, posted July 19, 2023, on Entrepreneur.com.

Many thank Bianca C. Calabresi and Ismerlyn Gonzalez who provided feedback, including Ismerlyn's highlight on the risk "it could further help some nefarious actors spread disinformation/misinformation" - one of the points to illustrate here with such technology.
